# first_scraper
This is a web scraper I made by following the first_web_scraper tutorial on readthedocs.org (http://first-web-scraper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  The website they use as the target appears to have been modified since the tutorial was written so I just found another website with a table.  I have no idea what I am going to do with a CSV of fantasy football QB picks.
